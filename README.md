# Sharpway
The code for my personal "build your own Segway"-project I started 10 years ago.

I originally started this project in C on my first Arduino. At some point I decided to go all in on C#/.Net and ported everything to a Netduino. This repository represents that.

# Requirements for replication

* NPC Robotics 24V 230 RPM 4-POLE BI-DIR GEAR MOTOR
* Sabertooth dual 60A motor driver 
* Wilderness Labs Netduino
* Analog Devices ADXL335 Accelerometer
* ST LPR530AL MEMS motion sensor: dual axis pitch and roll ±300°/s analog gyroscope
* Custom welded aluminum frame
* Wheels
* Lack of survival instinct

# Prototype

Here's what it looks like:
